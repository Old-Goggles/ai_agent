> This project is a simplified, educational prototype inspired by agentic coding tools (like Cursor/Zed's “Agentic Mode” and Claude Code). Even professionally-built tools can carry serious security risks if misused. **Do not share your API keys or embed them directly in the code.**
>
> Be mindful of what you allow this agent access to—running or modifying files can have unintended consequences. Never provide this agent with access to sensitive data or production systems. Share this repository with care and **never distribute your API credentials or this code to others without careful review.**

> You are solely responsible for how you use this agent and the data you expose to it.
